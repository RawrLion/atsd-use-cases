Up, Up, and Away - Analyzing UK Aviation Statistics using CAA datasets
======================================================================

### Introduction
----------------

Established in 1972, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) serves as an independent specialist for the UK government. Every quarter, the CAA collects and reports on key aviation metrics which summarize the level of activity at UK airports. According to their website, [caa.co.uk](https://www.caa.co.uk/Data-and-analysis/UK-aviation-market/Airports/Datasets/UK-Airport-data/Airport-data-2016-06/), the CAA collects statistics from more than 60 UK airports. The three main collected metrics are:

* Terminal passengers at UK airports
* Passenger flights to and from UK airports
* Air cargo tonnage carried to and from UK airports

These reports show the raw volumes of each metric and year over year (y-o-y) quarterly growth rates.

### CAA Dataset Formats
------------------------

Reports are published in CSV and PDF format. Multitudes of data are continuously added to these CAA datasets. It can be difficult to work though all the different files and revisions on CAA's website. Using Axibase's Time Series Database (ATSD), this process becomes much less cumbersome. Once you have raw data in ATSD, creating and sharing reports with built-in widgets is fairly trivial. The reports will be continuously updated as new data comes in.
