Up, Up, and Away - Analyzing UK Aviation Statistics using CAA datasets
===================================================================

### Introduction
----------------
3,667,629.

1,863,540.

1,413,261.

66,802.

These numbers represent the total number of passenger travelling from the United Kingdom (UK) to the Spain, United States, Italy, and Russia in June 2016, respectively. These numbers represent the following percentage changes: +14, +3, +11, -13. 

Air travel statistics can provide powerful insight into understanding the state of a country's economy. If an a country is prospering economically, this can lead to increased air travel and transportation. Vice a versa, hard economic times can lead to decreased air travel and transportation. 

Established in 1972, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) serves as an independent specialist for the UK government. Every quarter, the CAA collects and reports on key aviation metrics which summarize the level of activity at UK airports. According to their website, [caa.co.uk](https://www.caa.co.uk/Data-and-analysis/UK-aviation-market/Airports/Datasets/UK-Airport-data/Airport-data-2016-06/), the CAA collects statistics from more than 60 UK airports. The three main collected metrics are collected are:

* Terminal passengers at UK airports
* Passenger flights to and from UK airports
* Air cargo tonnage carried to and from UK airports

These reports show the raw volumes of each metric and year over year (y-o-y) quarterly growth rates.

### CAA Dataset Formats
-------------------------

Reports are published in CSV and PDF format. Multitudes of data are continuously added to these CAA datasets. It can be difficult to work though Axibase's Time Series Database (ATSD)
